## Overview

The **Bravo Benefits Platform** is a multi-tenant SaaS application providing employee benefits management and Total Reward Statements (TRS) to client organisations. This document covers the two foundational domains:

| Domain | Tables | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Identity & Auth** | `groups`, `sectors`, `lead_sources`, `organisations`, `users`, `user_org_memberships`, `org_teams`, `user_org_teams`, `org_internal_notes`, `image` | Identity, authentication, org structure, branding, and SSO |
| **Benefits & TRS** | `master_benefits`, `benefit_levels`, `org_benefits`, `org_benefit_team_levels`, `custom_tiles`, `benefit_requests`, `employee_benefit_status`, `trs_config`, `trs_component_types`, `trs_components`, `trs_employee_data`, `trs_statements` | Benefit catalogue, org offerings, and Total Reward Statements |

> **Scope note:** Domain 3 (R&R), Domain 4 (Content & Marketing), Domain 5 (Platform Config), and Domain 6 (Analytics) are intentionally excluded from this document.

---

## Architecture: Multi-Tenancy

Multi-tenancy in the Bravo Benefits platform is implemented using a **shared-database, shared-schema** strategy with two complementary isolation mechanisms:

### Primary Isolation — `org_uuid`

1. **Every `Base`-derived model** contains an `org_uuid` column (FK → `organisations.uuid`), automatically stamped on `save()` from `request.org_uuid`.
2. `Base.get_base_query()` automatically injects `.filter(org_uuid == <current_org>)` on every query, derived from the request context set by the authentication middleware.
3. If no `org_uuid` is present (background jobs, Bravo staff operations), queries return all records — enabling cross-organisation superadmin access.
4. Admin bypass methods (`get_by_uuid_global`, `get_by_org_uuid`) allow deliberate cross-organisation lookups.

### Secondary Isolation — `user_org_memberships`

The `user_org_memberships` table provides a second layer: **one user can belong to multiple organisations** with different roles. Every business operation that involves a user should resolve their active membership (`is_active=True`) for the current `org_uuid` before applying logic.

```
Request → Auth Middleware (sets request.org_uuid + request.user_uuid)
        → Base.get_base_query() → org_uuid filtered Results
        → UserOrgMembership.get_active() → role-gated logic
```

### Bravo Staff Bypass

Users flagged `is_bravo_user=True` on the `users` table are Bravo platform staff. They bypass the standard `org_uuid` filter (no membership required) and operate across all organisations.

> **Key Design Rules:**
> - Never query a business table without an `org_uuid` filter unless explicitly performing a Bravo-staff or admin operation.
> - `org_teams` (benefit-access teams) are entirely distinct from any R&R team concept — never merge them.
> - `organisations.force_2fa_for_all` is a **dedicated top-level Boolean column** (not inside `settings` JSONB) because it is queried at every authentication middleware invocation and must remain a first-class indexed field.

## Base Model & Common Fields

### `Base` (abstract — `app/models/base.py`)

All business models in this project inherit from `Base`. It provides the following standard columns on every table:

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `BigInteger` | PK, auto-increment | Internal surrogate primary key — never exposed in API responses |
| `uuid` | `String` | Unique | Public-facing universally unique identifier (UUID4) — used in all API references |
| `org_uuid` | `String` | FK → `organisations.uuid`, Nullable | Tenant isolation key; auto-stamped from request context on `save()` |
| `created_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | NOT NULL, default=now | Timestamp of record creation |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | NOT NULL, default=now, onupdate=now | Timestamp of last update |
| `deleted_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | Nullable | Soft-delete timestamp; `NULL` = active record |
| `created_by` | `String` | FK → `users.uuid`, Nullable | UUID of user who created the record (via `UserAuditMixin`) |
| `updated_by` | `String` | FK → `users.uuid`, Nullable | UUID of user who last updated the record (via `UserAuditMixin`) |
| `deleted_by` | `String` | FK → `users.uuid`, Nullable | UUID of user who soft-deleted the record (via `UserAuditMixin`) |

> **Note on `is_active`:** The `is_active` boolean is **retained** where it carries business semantics distinct from deletion (e.g., `org_teams.is_active` means "team is operational", not "deleted"). The standard `deleted_at` field handles true soft-deletes. Both may coexist on the same table.

### Abstract Sub-Bases

#### `PincodeBase` (extends `Base`)
Available for any location-aware models:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pincode` | `String` | Postal / ZIP code |
| `country` | `String` | Country name or ISO code |
| `state` | `String` | State / province |
| `city` | `String` | City name |

#### `FileBase` (extends `Base`)
Used by `image` and document-style models:

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `module_uuid` | `String` | Nullable | UUID of the owning module record |
| `module_type` | `String` | NOT NULL | Discriminator for the owning module type |
| `name` | `String` | Nullable | File name |
| `path` | `String` | Nullable | Storage path (S3 prefix) |
| `size` | `String` | Nullable | File size (stored as string) |
| `file_format` | `String` | Nullable | File extension / MIME type |
| `description` | `Text` | Nullable | Optional description |

---

## Mixins

### `UserAuditMixin` (`app/models/base.py`)

Injects `created_by`, `updated_by`, `deleted_by` FK columns (→ `users.uuid`) and their SQLAlchemy relationships (`created_by_user`, `updated_by_user`, `deleted_by_user`) via `@declared_attr`. Included in `Base` and `organisations` (which does not extend `Base` to avoid circular FK).

### `AuditableEvent` (`app/models/audit_event.py`)

Registers SQLAlchemy `after_insert`, `after_update`, `after_delete` listeners on any inheriting model. On each event, automatically writes a row to `audit_log` capturing:
- Table name, object ID, and action (`CREATE` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE`)
- `state_before` / `state_after` JSON snapshots of changed columns
- Request metadata (HTTP method, URL, IP) from Flask's request context

**Sensitive fields excluded from audit snapshots:** `password_hash`, `two_fa_secret`, `client_secret`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`.

All `Base`-derived models inherit `AuditableEvent` automatically.

### `SqlAlchemyEventMixin` (`app/models/event_mixin.py`)

Provides overridable lifecycle hooks for fine-grained SQLAlchemy event handling:

| Hook | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `on_before_insert` / `on_after_insert` | Row insert |
| `on_before_update` / `on_after_update` | Row update |
| `on_before_delete` / `on_after_delete` | Row delete |
| `on_before_flush` / `on_after_flush` | Session flush |
| `on_before_commit` | Session commit |

Recommended for: `users`, `user_org_memberships` — models with complex domain lifecycle logic (e.g., triggering notifications, enforcing business rules on membership state changes).

## Table Definitions

---

### Domain 1 — Core Identity & Auth

---

### `groups`

**Business Purpose:** Org group entities managed by Bravo staff. Enables group admins to push documents and notices across multiple linked organisations simultaneously. Does **not** extend `Base` — it is a platform-level lookup with no org tenancy scope.

**Base Class:** `db.Model` + `UserAuditMixin`

#### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `BigInteger` | PK, auto-increment | Internal surrogate primary key — never exposed in API responses |
| `uuid` | `String` | Unique | Public UUID used as the FK reference (`group_uuid`) in `organisations` |
| `group_name` | `String(200)` | NOT NULL | Human-facing display name of the group, shown in the Bravo staff dashboard group-picker |
| `is_active` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=True | Controls whether the group appears as selectable in the admin UI; inactive groups still serve their linked orgs |
| `created_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | NOT NULL, default=now | Record creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | NOT NULL, default=now | Last update timestamp |
| `created_by` | `String` | FK → `users.uuid`, Nullable | UUID of the Bravo staff user who created this group (via `UserAuditMixin`) |
| `updated_by` | `String` | FK → `users.uuid`, Nullable | UUID of the Bravo staff user who last modified this group (via `UserAuditMixin`) |

---

### `sectors`

**Business Purpose:** Industry sector lookup table used purely for CRM classification of organisations. Managed exclusively by Bravo staff — client orgs cannot create or modify sectors. Platform-level lookup with no org tenancy scope.

**Base Class:** `db.Model` + `UserAuditMixin`

#### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `BigInteger` | PK, auto-increment | Internal surrogate primary key |
| `uuid` | `String` | Unique | Public UUID referenced as `sector_uuid` on `organisations` |
| `sector_name` | `String(150)` | NOT NULL | Human-facing sector label shown in the organisation creation form (e.g. `Financial Services`, `Healthcare`) |
| `is_active` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=True | Whether this sector is selectable when creating or editing an organisation |
| `created_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | NOT NULL, default=now | Record creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | NOT NULL, default=now | Last update timestamp |

---

### `lead_sources`

**Business Purpose:** Hierarchical lead source lookup for CRM tracking, recording how each client organisation was acquired. Supports self-referential parent-child groupings (e.g. a `Digital` header with `LinkedIn`, `Google Ads` children). Managed by Bravo staff only.

**Base Class:** `db.Model` + `UserAuditMixin`

#### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `BigInteger` | PK, auto-increment | Internal surrogate primary key |
| `uuid` | `String` | Unique | Public UUID referenced as `lead_source_uuid` on `organisations` |
| `parent_uuid` | `String` | FK → `lead_sources.uuid`, Nullable | Self-referential parent UUID; NULL = root-level node. Allows grouping sub-sources under a common header |
| `source_name` | `String(200)` | NOT NULL | Display name of the lead source shown in the org CRM form |
| `is_subheader` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=False | When True, this row renders as a non-selectable display subheader in the dropdown — used purely for visual grouping |
| `display_order` | `Integer` | NOT NULL, default=0 | Controls sort order within a parent group; lower = higher in the list |
| `is_active` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=True | Whether this source is selectable on the org form |
| `created_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | NOT NULL, default=now | Record creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | NOT NULL, default=now | Last update timestamp |

#### Relationships

| Name | Target | Type | Description | Cascade Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `parent` | `LeadSource` | Self Many-to-One | Parent lead source category | `ON DELETE SET NULL` — orphaned child becomes a root node |
| `children` | `LeadSource` | Self One-to-Many | Child lead source entries | `ON DELETE SET NULL` |

---

### `organisations`

**Business Purpose:** Root tenant entity representing a client company. Every piece of business data in the platform is scoped to an organisation via `org_uuid`. Does **not** extend `Base` — avoids circular FK dependencies since `Base` itself has `org_uuid → organisations.uuid`. Branding, feature flags, and SSO configuration are all consolidated into the `settings` JSONB column to reduce table width and group related configuration logically.

**Base Class:** `db.Model` + `UserAuditMixin`

> ⚡ **Naming Note:** The Bravo schema uses `organisations` (British English). The public FK reference throughout the codebase is `org_uuid` (standardized from the original `org_id`). The internal `id` (BigInteger PK) and `uuid` (String, unique) follow standard boilerplate conventions.

#### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `BigInteger` | PK, auto-increment | Internal surrogate primary key |
| `uuid` | `String` | Unique, default=uuid4 | Public identifier; used as the `org_uuid` FK value in every child table across the platform |
| `group_uuid` | `String` | FK → `groups.uuid`, Nullable | Links this org to a Bravo group, enabling group admins to push content across all member orgs simultaneously |
| `sector_uuid` | `String` | FK → `sectors.uuid`, Nullable | Industry sector classification used for CRM reporting and segmentation |
| `lead_source_uuid` | `String` | FK → `lead_sources.uuid`, Nullable | Records how this client was acquired; used for marketing attribution in the Bravo staff CRM view |
| `consultant_user_uuid` | `String` | FK → `users.uuid`, Nullable | UUID of the assigned Bravo consultant responsible for onboarding this org |
| `account_manager_user_uuid` | `String` | FK → `users.uuid`, Nullable | UUID of the assigned Bravo account manager for ongoing commercial relationship |
| `company_name` | `String(255)` | NOT NULL | Official company trading name; displayed as the org's identity throughout the platform |
| `sage_id` | `String(100)` | Nullable | Billing reference code in Sage accounting; used for invoice matching |
| `platform_type` | `String(10)` | NOT NULL, default=`full`, CHECK IN (`full`, `basic`) | Platform tier — `full` has all modules enabled; `basic` is a lighter offering with a restricted feature set |
| `launch_date` | `Date` | Nullable | The date the platform formally launched for this org's employees; used in onboarding scheduling |
| `employee_count` | `Integer` | Nullable | Expected or actual headcount; used for license sizing and bulk upload validation |
| `self_registration_url` | `Text` | Unique, Nullable | Unique URL slug used for employee self-registration without an admin invite |
| `force_2fa_for_all` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=False | **Dedicated top-level column** — when True, every user in this org is required to complete 2FA on login, regardless of their personal 2FA setting. Queried at every auth middleware invocation and must remain a first-class indexed field, not buried in JSONB |
| `settings` | `JSONB` | NOT NULL, default=`{}` | Consolidated org configuration blob. Contains three sub-objects: `branding` (visual identity), `features` (module feature flags), and `sso` (single sign-on configuration). See **`settings` JSONB Structure** below |
| `status` | `String(20)` | NOT NULL, default=`active`, CHECK IN (`active`, `suspended`, `closed`) | Organisation lifecycle status — `suspended` blocks employee logins while retaining data; `closed` triggers GDPR retention clock |
| `closed_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | Nullable | Timestamp when this org was formally closed; triggers the GDPR data retention deadline calculation |
| `retain_until` | `DateTime (tz)` | Nullable | GDPR data retention deadline, computed as `closed_at + 7 years`; set by the application on closure |
| `created_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | NOT NULL, default=now | Record creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | NOT NULL, default=now | Last update timestamp |
| `deleted_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | Nullable | Soft-delete timestamp; NULL = active |
| `created_by` | `String` | FK → `users.uuid`, Nullable | Bravo staff user who created this org record (via `UserAuditMixin`) |
| `updated_by` | `String` | FK → `users.uuid`, Nullable | Bravo staff user who last modified this org record (via `UserAuditMixin`) |
| `deleted_by` | `String` | FK → `users.uuid`, Nullable | Bravo staff user who soft-deleted this org record (via `UserAuditMixin`) |

> **SQLAlchemy `__table_args__` Note:** The following string ENUM columns require explicit `CheckConstraint` entries in the model's `__table_args__`:
> - `platform_type`: `CheckConstraint("platform_type IN ('full', 'basic')", name='ck_organisations_platform_type')`
> - `status`: `CheckConstraint("status IN ('active', 'suspended', 'closed')", name='ck_organisations_status')`

#### `settings` JSONB Structure

The `settings` column stores three logically grouped sub-objects. Developers should access nested values via `org.settings.get('branding', {}).get('logo_url')` pattern with safe fallbacks.

```json
{
  "branding": {
    "primary_hex":       "<string|null>",
    "secondary_hex":     "<string|null>",
    "logo_url":          "<string|null>",
    "header_image_url":  "<string|null>",
    "welcome_message":   "<string|null>"
  },
  "features": {
    "show_adverts":        "<boolean>",
    "show_fact_sheets":    "<boolean>",
    "is_bravo_broker":     "<boolean>",
    "is_trs_enabled":      "<boolean>",
    "is_rnr_enabled":      "<boolean>",
    "ni_number_mandatory": "<boolean>"
  },
  "sso": {
    "provider":      "<string|null>",
    "is_enabled":    "<boolean>",

    "client_secret": "<string|null>",
    "tenant_id":     "<string|null>",
    "metadata_url":  "<string|null>"
  }
}
```

#### Relationships

| Name | Target | Type | Description | Cascade Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `idx_orgs_force_2fa` | `force_2fa_for_all` | Index — queried on every auth check |
| *(standard)* | `uuid` | Unique |

---

### `users`

**Business Purpose:** Single identity record for every human who can log in — Bravo staff, org admins, or employees. PII is held here and subject to GDPR anonymisation on account closure (`gdpr_anonymised_at`). A user may belong to multiple organisations via `user_org_memberships` rows; this table holds only identity-level data that is consistent across all org contexts.

**Base Class:** `Base` + `SqlAlchemyEventMixin`

> ⚡ **Naming Note:** Original schema used `user_id VARCHAR(12)` as PK. Standardized to `id` (BigInteger PK) + `uuid` (String, unique) pattern. References to `user_id` in child tables are updated to `user_uuid`.

#### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(Base fields)* | — | — | `id`, `uuid`, `org_uuid`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `deleted_by` |
| `primary_email` | `String(255)` | Unique, NOT NULL | Primary login email address; globally unique across the platform — one account per email |
| `password_hash` | `Text` | Nullable | Bcrypt password hash; NULL for SSO-only users who authenticate entirely via their IdP |

| `last_name` | `String(100)` | NOT NULL, default=`""` | User's last name; scrambled on GDPR anonymisation |
| `is_bravo_user` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=False | Marks this account as a Bravo platform staff member; bypasses all `org_uuid` filter injection in `Base.get_base_query()` |
| `two_fa_enabled` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=False | Whether the user has personally enabled 2FA via TOTP setup; overridden by `organisations.force_2fa_for_all` at auth time |
| `two_fa_secret` | `Text` | Nullable | Encrypted TOTP 2FA secret; excluded from all audit log snapshots |
| `gdpr_anonymised_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | Nullable | Timestamp when PII was anonymised in compliance with GDPR on org closure; signals downstream services to exclude this user from communications |
| `suppress_all_adverts` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=False | User-level advert suppression override; when True, Bravo adverts are never shown to this user regardless of org settings |
| `is_active` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=True | Global account active flag; False blocks all logins across every org membership |
| `last_login_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | Nullable | Timestamp of most recent successful login; used for inactive user reporting |

#### Relationships

| Name | Target | Type | Description | Cascade Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `memberships` | `UserOrgMembership` | One-to-Many | All org memberships for this user | `ON DELETE RESTRICT` — user cannot be deleted while memberships exist |
| `oauth_accounts` | `OAuthAccount` | One-to-Many | Linked OAuth provider accounts | `ON DELETE CASCADE` — OAuth accounts are destroyed with the user |

#### Indexes & Constraints

| Name | Columns | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `uq_users_primary_email` | `primary_email` | Unique |
| `idx_users_active` | `is_active` | Index |
| *(Base)* | `uuid` | Unique |

---

### `user_org_memberships`

**Business Purpose:** The heart of role-based access in the platform. One row represents one user's relationship to one organisation — a user can hold multiple memberships across different orgs with different roles. Employment data that varies per-org context (salary, NI number, dates) lives here. Notification preferences and bookmarked benefits are consolidated as JSONB columns here to eliminate the previously separate `notification_preferences` and `employee_favourite_benefits` tables.

For inter-company moves, the old membership is deactivated (`is_active=False`, `deleted_at` set) and a new one is created; `source_membership_uuid` links the lineage.

**Base Class:** `Base` + `SqlAlchemyEventMixin`

#### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(Base fields)* | — | — | `id`, `uuid`, `org_uuid`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `deleted_by` |

| `role` | `String(20)` | NOT NULL, default=`employee`, CHECK IN (`bravo_admin`, `bravo_staff`, `group_admin`, `org_admin`, `rnr_admin`, `employee`, `consultant`, `hr_team`, `freelancer`) | Role within this specific org context; controls which views, actions, and data the user can access |
| `is_primary_org` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=True | Whether this is the user's primary organisation; determines which org is loaded on default login when the user belongs to multiple orgs |
| `ni_number` | `String(20)` | Nullable | UK National Insurance number; unique among active memberships per org when present — enforced via partial unique index |
| `employee_number` | `String(50)` | Nullable | Employer-assigned employee reference number; used for HR system correlation and bulk upload matching |

### `org_teams`

**Business Purpose:** Benefit-access teams within an organisation. Controls which employees can access which org benefits via `org_benefit_team_levels`. Entirely distinct from R&R teams — these teams exist purely to segment benefit visibility and TRS calculation tiers within a client org.

**Base Class:** `Base`

#### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(Base fields)* | — | — | `id`, `uuid`, `org_uuid`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `deleted_by` |

### `benefit_levels`

**Business Purpose:** Named calculation-tier definitions for a master benefit (e.g. `Director`, `Employee`, `Senior Manager`). These levels drive the TRS calculation hierarchy: master benefit level → org benefit override → team grid assignment (`org_benefit_team_levels`). Each level defines a calculation method and value; the actual team-to-level mapping lives in `org_benefit_team_levels`.

**Base Class:** `Base`

#### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(Base fields)* | — | — | `id`, `uuid`, `org_uuid` (NULL — platform-level), `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `deleted_by` |

| `level_name` | `String(100)` | NOT NULL | Display name of the level shown to org admins in the TRS configuration UI (e.g. `Director`, `Employee`) |
| `display_order` | `Integer` | NOT NULL, default=0 | Sort order within the benefit's level list; lower = shown first |
| `calc_method` | `String(30)` | NOT NULL, default=`not_set`, CHECK IN (`salary_multiple`, `salary_percentage`, `fixed_amount`, `rate_per_thousand`, `individual`, `not_set`) | Calculation method applied at this tier: `salary_multiple` = gross × value; `salary_percentage` = gross × value/100; `fixed_amount` = value directly; `rate_per_thousand` = (gross / 1000) × value; `individual` = per-employee manual entry; `not_set` = not yet configured |
| `calc_value` | `Numeric(12,4)` | Nullable | The multiplier, percentage, rate, or fixed amount used by `calc_method`; NULL when `calc_method = not_set` |

> **SQLAlchemy `__table_args__` Note:** `calc_method` requires:
> `CheckConstraint("calc_method IN ('salary_multiple','salary_percentage','fixed_amount','rate_per_thousand','individual','not_set')", name='ck_benefit_levels_calc_method')`

#### Relationships

| Name | Target | Type | Description | Cascade Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `benefit` | `MasterBenefit` | Many-to-One | Parent master benefit | `ON DELETE CASCADE` — levels are intrinsic to the benefit definition and removed if the master benefit is deleted |

---

### `org_benefits`

**Business Purpose:** A master benefit configured and activated for a specific organisation. The `status` column drives employee-facing visibility. Org-specific copywritten content (4 context variants), the bespoke attachment URL, and token substitution answers are consolidated into two JSONB columns (`data` and `token_answers`) to eliminate the previously separate `org_benefit_token_answers` table and reduce top-level column count.

**Base Class:** `Base`

#### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| `hide_for_employee` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=False | Org-level override — when True, the benefit is visible to org admins only, hidden from all employee views regardless of `status` |
| `is_featured` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=False | When True, this benefit is promoted to the featured section on the employee benefits homepage |
| `display_order` | `Integer` | NOT NULL, default=0 | Sort order on the benefits listing page; lower = appears first |
| `go_live_at` | `DateTime (tz)` | Nullable | Scheduled datetime (UK timezone) for the background scheduler to automatically flip `status` from `market` → `offer` |
| `data` | `JSONB` | Nullable, default=`{}` | Org-specific copywritten content overrides and attachment URL. See **`data` JSONB Structure** below |
| `token_answers` | `JSONB` | Nullable, default=`{}` | Key-value map of token substitution answers provided by the org admin. Replaces the deleted `org_benefit_token_answers` table. See **`token_answers` JSONB Structure** below |

> **SQLAlchemy `__table_args__` Note:** `status` requires:
> `CheckConstraint("status IN ('offer', 'market', 'hidden', 'refused', 'draft')", name='ck_org_benefits_status')`

#### `data` JSONB Structure

Stores org-level content overrides for the 4-context display matrix, plus the bespoke attachment URL. When a key is present and non-null, it overrides the corresponding value from `master_benefits.data`. When null/absent, the master benefit's value is used as the fallback.

```json
{
  "ctx_market_company":   "<string|null>",
  "ctx_offer_company":    "<string|null>",
  "ctx_market_employee":  "<string|null>",
  "ctx_offer_employee":   "<string|null>",
  "bespoke_attachment_url": "<string|null>"
}
```

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

```json
{
  "{{SCHEME_URL}}":  "https://orgname.schemeprovider.co.uk",
  "{{UNIQUE_CODE}}": "ORG123XYZ"
}
```

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `<token_key>` (e.g. `{{SCHEME_URL}}`) | `String` | The substitution token placeholder from `master_benefits.required_tokens[*].token_key` as the map key; the org's answer string as the value. Used by the content rendering engine to substitute placeholders in `data` fields and email templates. *Replaces the deleted `org_benefit_token_answers` table.* |

#### Relationships

| Name | Target | Type | Description | Cascade Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `team_levels` | `OrgBenefitTeamLevel` | One-to-Many | Team-specific benefit level assignments | `ON DELETE CASCADE` — level assignments removed with the org benefit |

#### Indexes & Constraints

| Name | Columns | Type |
|---|---|---|

### `org_benefit_team_levels`

**Business Purpose:** Tier 3 of the TRS calculation hierarchy — assigns a specific `benefit_level` to a team within an org benefit configuration. This is the junction between org teams and benefit levels, determining which TRS calculation rate applies to employees in a given team for a given benefit.

**Base Class:** `Base`

#### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(Base fields)* | — | — | `id`, `uuid`, `org_uuid`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `deleted_by` |

---

### `custom_tiles`

**Business Purpose:** Org-created benefit tiles for non-Bravo offerings — competitions, TypeForm surveys, seasonal promotions, or any external content the org wants to surface to employees. Renamed from `custom_benefits` to better reflect that these are UI tile entries, not benefit catalogue items. The `visible_to_team_uuids` JSONB array replaces the deleted `custom_benefit_team_access` many-to-many join table, simplifying team visibility management into a single column.

**Base Class:** `Base`

#### Columns

| `display_order` | `Integer` | NOT NULL, default=0 | Sort order on the benefits/tiles listing page; lower = appears first |
| `status` | `String(10)` | NOT NULL, default=`active`, CHECK IN (`active`, `disabled`, `deleted`) | Lifecycle status: `active` = visible; `disabled` = hidden (e.g. seasonal promotion off-season); `deleted` = soft-deleted |
| `visible_to_team_uuids` | `JSONB` | Nullable, default=`[]` | Array of `org_teams.uuid` strings restricting visibility to specific teams. When the array is empty (`[]`) or null, the tile is visible to **all teams** in the org. Replaces the deleted `custom_benefit_team_access` many-to-many join table. See **`visible_to_team_uuids` JSONB Structure** below |

> **SQLAlchemy `__table_args__` Note:** The following ENUM columns require `CheckConstraint` entries:
> - `embed_type`: `CheckConstraint("embed_type IN ('external_url', 'html_embed')", name='ck_custom_tiles_embed_type')`

["<org_team_uuid_1>", "<org_team_uuid_2>"]
```

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| *(array element)* | `String (UUID)` | UUID string referencing an `org_teams.uuid` value. When the array is populated, only employees who are members of one of these teams (via `user_org_teams`) will see this tile. An empty array or null means all teams in the org can see it. *Replaces the deleted `custom_benefit_team_access` join table.* |

#### Indexes & Constraints

| Name | Columns | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `idx_custom_tiles_org` | `org_uuid` | Index |
| `idx_custom_tiles_group` | `group_uuid` | Index — used when resolving group-pushed tiles across member orgs |

### `trs_component_types`

**Business Purpose:** System-defined TRS component taxonomy — the master list of component categories (salary, pension, bonus, etc.) that Bravo staff define at platform level. Each type defines a default calculation method. Org-level configurations (`trs_components`) reference these types. Managed exclusively by Bravo staff — not editable by client orgs.

**Base Class:** `db.Model` + `UserAuditMixin` (platform lookup — no org scope)

| `color_hex` | `String(7)` | Nullable | Default display colour used for this component's segment in TRS pie/bar charts (e.g. `#4A90E2`) |

> **SQLAlchemy `__table_args__` Note:** The following ENUM columns require `CheckConstraint` entries:
> - `type_name`: `CheckConstraint("type_name IN ('salary','pension','bonus','benefit_value','allowance','holiday_value','insurance','other')", name='ck_trs_component_types_type_name')`
> - `calc_method`: `CheckConstraint("calc_method IN ('salary_multiple','salary_percentage','fixed_amount','rate_per_thousand','individual','not_set')", name='ck_trs_component_types_calc_method')`

---

### `trs_components`

**Business Purpose:** Per-org TRS component configuration — specifies which system component types are active for this org, how they are labelled, and what calculation parameters apply. Acts as the org-level customisation layer over the platform-defined `trs_component_types`.

| `display_order` | `Integer` | NOT NULL, default=0 | Sort order for this component in the TRS employee view and PDF |
| `is_visible_to_employee` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=True | When False, this component is included in the total calculation but hidden from the employee-facing TRS view |
| `is_active` | `Boolean` | NOT NULL, default=True | Whether this component is currently active for this org; inactive components are excluded from TRS calculations and the employee view |

#### Indexes & Constraints

| `two_fa_policy` | `organisations.force_2fa_for_all` (top-level Boolean) | Copy `two_fa_policy.force_2fa_for_all` → `organisations.force_2fa_for_all` per org. The `bravo_admin_always_2fa` flag is now platform-enforced at the application layer — no storage needed. |
| `sso_config` | `organisations.settings['sso']` (JSONB sub-object) | Copy `provider`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `is_enabled`, `metadata_url` into `settings.sso` per org. Add `tenant_id` (new field, default null). |
| `notification_preferences` | `user_org_memberships.notification_preferences` (JSONB column) | Copy all 6 boolean columns into a JSONB object keyed by column name, one row per membership. |
| `employee_favourite_benefits` | `user_org_memberships.favourite_benefit_uuids` (JSONB Array) | Aggregate `org_benefit_uuid` values per `membership_uuid` into an ordered array (order by `created_at` ASC). |
| `benefit_resources` | `master_benefits.resources` (JSONB Array) | Aggregate all resources per `benefit_uuid` ordered by `display_order` ASC into the array. |
| `benefit_tokens` | `master_benefits.required_tokens` (JSONB Array) | Aggregate all token definitions per `benefit_uuid` into the array. |
| `org_benefit_token_answers` | `org_benefits.token_answers` (JSONB Object) | For each `org_benefit_uuid`, build a `{token_key: answer_value}` map by joining `org_benefit_token_answers` → `benefit_tokens` on `token_uuid`. |
| `custom_benefit_team_access` | `custom_tiles.visible_to_team_uuids` (JSONB Array) | Aggregate `team_uuid` values per `custom_benefit_uuid` into the array. Empty array = visible to all (preserve existing semantics). |
